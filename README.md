Title:	   MultiMarkdown Gallery  
Author:	   Fletcher T. Penney  

# Introduction #

This project is really just a collection of sample MultiMarkdown documents
demonstrating various features.


## Sample-Document ##

This is the original MultiMarkdown Sample Document. The source file,
`sample.txt`, demonstrates the original MultiMarkdown markup. The other files
show the output when converted to HTML/XHTML, TeX (using `mmd2LaTeX.pl`) PDF
(using `mmd2pdf.pl`), RTF (using the `multimarkdown2RTF.pl` script), and RTFD
(using TextEdit to convert the XHTML document to RTF with images).
