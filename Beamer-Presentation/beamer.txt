# MultiMarkdown and Beamer #

## What is it? ##


#### What is MultiMarkdown? ####

[MultiMarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/ "MultiMarkdown") is a derivative of John Gruber's [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "Daring Fireball: Markdown").

Basically, it converts plain text into pretty documents:

* HTML
* PDF
* RTF
* and, now, PDF presentations

#### What is Beamer? ####

[Beamer](http://latex-beamer.sourceforge.net/ "The LaTeX Beamer Class Homepage") is a [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) class that allows you to create PDF presentations, such as this one.

My goal is not to teach you the ins and outs of Beamer, or LaTeX for that
matter. Rather, I want to show you the settings that you need to convert a
MultiMarkdown document into a Beamer presentation.

## How do you use it? ##

#### Stuff to install ####

You need a working installation of:

* MultiMarkdown
* LaTeX (including pdflatex)
* xsltproc
* the beamer class

*If you can create a regular PDF via LaTeX from MultiMarkdown, you are probably good to go.*

#### Optional Stuff ####

* I like Shawn Lankton's [keynote theme](http://www.shawnlankton.com/2008/02/beamer-and-latex-with-keynote-theme/) for beamer. I made a of slight modification for my own version, which is what you see here.

* It's much more attractive than the default themes, but still has room for improvement.

* You can find some additional Keynote knock-offs by [Ed Long](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucbpeal/latexposter.html)
